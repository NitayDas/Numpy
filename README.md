## Introduction

NumPy is the fundamental package for scientific computing in Python. It provides support for arrays, matrices, and many mathematical functions.

## Installation

To install NumPy, you need to have Python installed on your system. You can install NumPy using pip:

```bash
pip install numpy

Alternatively, if you are using Anaconda, you can install NumPy using conda:

bash

conda install numpy

Basic Usage

Here are some basic examples to get you started with NumPy.
Creating Arrays

You can create NumPy arrays using the numpy.array function:

python

import numpy as np

# Create a 1D array
array_1d = np.array([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])
print(array_1d)

# Create a 2D array
array_2d = np.array([[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]])
print(array_2d)

Array Operations

NumPy allows you to perform element-wise operations on arrays:

python

# Element-wise addition
array_sum = array_1d + 2
print(array_sum)

# Element-wise multiplication
array_product = array_1d * 2
print(array_product)

Indexing and Slicing

You can access elements of a NumPy array using indexing and slicing:

python

# Indexing
first_element = array_1d[0]
print(first_element)

# Slicing
subset_array = array_1d[1:4]
print(subset_array)

Common Functions

NumPy provides many useful functions for mathematical operations:

python

# Mean of an array
mean_value = np.mean(array_1d)
print(mean_value)

# Standard deviation of an array
std_deviation = np.std(array_1d)
print(std_deviation)

# Sum of all elements in an array
sum_of_elements = np.sum(array_1d)
print(sum_of_elements)
